# Movie browser app

### Tech stack
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* React

### Requirements
The objective is to build an app to browse a set of movies

* For all the movie data you can use [Studio Ghibli API](https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com)
* Design wise you're free to do what you want, you can search any templates
on the web and get the inspiration from there

### App Structure
* Initial section with a banner with a featured movie with minimal info, like netflix does
* Second section with "most viewed movies". A list of 6 movies, displayed on
two rows. So, 6 "cards" or "blocks" with a small image and name of the movie
* A "View all" button should be present, and, upon click, should toggle all
the movies below it.
* Upon clicking on any movie "card" or "block" a modal should open with ALL the
information for the movie.

### Notes
* Use the least 3rd party libraries you can
* DO NOT use any `router library` or `redux`
* For styling you can use whatever you want, I recommend [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/)
* For API calls you either use the native `fetch` or `axios`

* Bonus points for adding tests
* Bonus points for responsive styles

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
